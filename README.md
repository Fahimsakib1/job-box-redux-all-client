# Job Hunter (Job Portal For You)


## Project Features
- Job Hunter is an online platform for Job seekers and employers who want to post jobs. Basically this website is a full package which allows candidate to find jobs based on their desire and they can apply on those jobs. Besides Employer can add jobs. This website is made by using React Router DOM, Firebase Authentication, amd Mongodb as the database. Redux is used in this website to make the API calls and all the functionality is managed by Redux Toolkit and RTK query. Besides tailwind css is used for the styling purpose.

- React hot toast and sweet alert is added to show the alerts for better user experience. For the server side I have used node.js and express.js for the server purpose. As, there are some major users in this project so, I have made a dashboard and differentiate the users based on their role. Employer can see Add Jobs and a candidate can see the jobs he has applied in the dashboard.

- Authentication is an important part of the website. There are some routes that are private routes. Which means a user can not visit the route if he is not logged in. For the Authentication purpose I have used the google's Firebase authentication system. I have added some authentication systems. Email-Password Login and Google Login.

- Candidate can add Question to a job if he encounters any confusion about the job post. Where as, the employer will reply to the corresponding question in the ral time.

- Chatting with the employer is of the main features in this website. An employer can send message to a candidate if the employer finds the candidate suitable for the job role. Candidate can reply to the message. Both the employers and candidate can send images in this portal for better communication. All the messages and replies are shown in real time
